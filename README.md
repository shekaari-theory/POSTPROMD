\item This is the first distribution of POSTPROMD: a post-processor package for all-scale/all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

\item Please, refer to \href{https://doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/aaeaa6}{[1]} for information about the mathematical relations used in POSTPROMD.
\item Written in: Fortran and BASH\\Operating System: Linux
\item Purpose: To compute three important phase transition indicators including: the Lindemann index (root-mean-square bond length fluctuation), mean square displacement (MSD) of atoms, and radial distribution function (RDF) of systems of atoms/particles. This package is compatible with both quantum and classical MD simulations; nevertheless, it has originally been written to post-process the MD output file {\texttt{cp.pos}} generated by the CPV package of \href{https://www.quantum-espresso.org/}{Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)}.
\item Main input files: {\texttt{cp.pos}} and {\texttt{par.dat}}.
\item {\texttt{par.dat}}: contains a number of QE MD numerical parameters as follows:
\\{\texttt{n0}} = Total number of particles (also included in QE md input file).
\\{\texttt{nstep0}} = Total number of steps (also included in QE md input file).
\\{\texttt{iprint0}} = Number of steps between successive output writings (also included in QE md input file).
\\{\texttt{ign0}} = Number of steps for thermalization/thermal equilibration, usually about 1000 or 2000 steps, to have reliable statistical averages.\\
\\{\texttt{dt0}} = Time-step included in the 1st row, 2nd column of the QE md output file {\texttt{cp.pos}}.
\\{\texttt{dt00}} = Time-step in the QE md input file.
\\{\texttt{delta\_r0}} = Move step/scale from center of mass (COM) of the system on, it is a very sensitive parameter, the value 0.0005 \AA\ works well.\\
\\{\texttt{rmax0}} = Distance from COM to the outermost shell of the system, Example: 5 \AA\ for B$_{36}$ nanocluster\href{https://doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/aaeaa6}{[2]}.
\item Code Details:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{lind.sh}}
\\Purpose: Computes the Lindemann index (root-mean-square bond length fluctuation/delta\_rms) of a system of atoms/particles.
\\Input files: {\texttt{cp.pos}} $|$ {\texttt{par.dat}} $|$ {\texttt{ln.source}}
\\Output file: No file

\item {\texttt{msd.sh}}
\\Purpose: Computes mean square displacement of every atom/particle of the system.
\\Input files: {\texttt{cp.pos}} $|$ {\texttt{par.dat}} $|$ {\texttt{msd.source}}
\\Output files: {\texttt{msd***.dat}} contained in directory {\texttt{msd\_output\_files}}. The user has to plot the output files each containing 2 columns of data, in order: time-step and MSD.
\\
\item {\texttt{rdf.sh}}
\\Purpose: Computes radial distribution function (RDF) of a system of atoms/particles.
\\Input files: {\texttt{cp.pos}} $|$ {\texttt{par.dat}} $|$ {\texttt{rdf.source}}
\\Output file: {\texttt{rdf5.dat}} contained in directory {\texttt{rdf\_output\_file}}, including 5 columns, in order: r, rdf on xy plane, rdf on xz plane, rdf on yz plane, and rdf in three dimensions. The user also has to plot this file.
\end{itemize} 
\item How To Run:
\\1- No need to install.
\\2- Unzip POSTPROMD compressed file.
\\3- Put the QE MD output file {\texttt{cp.pos}} in POSTPROMD root directory.
\\4- Edit the file {\texttt{par.dat}} as described above.
\\5- To compute Lindemann index, run in terminal: {\texttt{bash lind.sh}}
\\6- To compute MSD, run in terminal: {\texttt{bash msd.sh}}
\\7- To compute RDF, run in terminal: {\texttt{bash rdf.sh}}
\item Example File: This distribution contains an example file that simulates molecular dynamics of the unit cell of SLSiN (single-layer Si$_3$N$_4$), containing 14 atoms, within the Car-Parrinello approach, at T = 5 K. For more information on SLSiN, please refer to \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2020.109693}{[3]}.
